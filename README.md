# LinSerialNetwork

Includes all .ino files and C/C++ files used in the project 

The hexidecial numbers in the files names are the IDs assigned to that given node. 
For example the Blue Dot has ID of 0x09 to recieve data and 0x0A to respond to the network

The C/C++ files need to just have their Serial number changed depending on what serial port you are using.
In our case we used the teensy 4.0 serial port 3 so we used Serial3 to write to that port
